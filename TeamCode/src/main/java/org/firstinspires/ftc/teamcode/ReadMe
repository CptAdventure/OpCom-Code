Things that have been done

I set up a framework for running the autonomous code, it uses the Autonomous Commands
how it works is that you make a command class that implements the ICommand interface and has a function called
run the returns a boolean
read the comments in ICommand and the autoTest op mode

don't put any waits in the run command
the run command should need to be run multiple times continuously until its finished.
so the run command should check if its met its objective and if it hasn't do somthing that gets it closer to its objective
ex. if you were making a command to use the vision to navigate to a position on the field
run would
1) check where it is on the field
    A) if it can't see where it is then it should maybe start turning to look for the pictures
2) if we are where we are supposed to be then return true
3) using the current position determine which direction it needs to go
4) set the motors to drive in the correct direction


there are a few robot components that should be useful, only the drive and vision ones should be working
the other ones need to be coded


Things to do
what you need to do is make all the robot components, these components should have variables
for all the motors and sensors they use, and methods to do the things you want the component to be able to do.
!!!!!!!Dont have any references to gamepads in the components, you want to be able to use these components in
the autonomous time when you don't have access to the gamepads!!!!!!!
